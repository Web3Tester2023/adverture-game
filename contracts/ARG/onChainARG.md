### Let's design a blockchain-based (on-chain) alternate reality game (ARG) with social impact on the Arbitrum network. What are some ideas we can start working with?

Another potential angle for a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network could be to create a game that focuses on community-building and collaboration. The game could involve players working together to achieve common goals, such as completing collective challenges or building virtual structures or environments. The use of smart contracts and other blockchain technologies could enable the game to track and verify players' contributions, and reward them accordingly.


### I want to create an on-chain blockchain-based ARG on arbitrum that focuses on community-building and collaboration. Please describe some cool games ideas around the theme "Adventurers".

One idea for a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network with a focus on community-building and collaboration could be a game that involves players taking on the roles of adventurers in a fantasy world. The game could involve players working together to explore new territories, complete quests, and defeat monsters, with the goal of earning rewards for their contributions.

A) The game could use smart contracts on the Arbitrum network to track players' actions and progress, and to distribute rewards for their achievements. For example, players who successfully complete a quest could earn a certain amount of in-game currency or tokens, which they could then use to purchase new equipment or unlock new abilities.

B) Additionally, the game could incorporate elements of player-driven storytelling, where players can create and share their own adventures and challenges for others to take on. This could add an extra layer of collaboration and community-building to the game, as players would need to work together to create and solve the various challenges and puzzles within the game.

Overall, a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network with a focus on community-building and collaboration could provide an engaging and immersive gaming experience, while also promoting teamwork and cooperation among players.

### For (A), What does an MVP of this game look like?

An MVP (minimum viable product) of a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network with a focus on community-building and collaboration could include the following features:

1. Basic gameplay mechanics: The MVP would include the core gameplay mechanics of the game, such as the ability for players to create and customize their adventurer characters, explore the game world, and complete quests and challenges.

2. Smart contract integration: The MVP would use smart contracts on the Arbitrum network to track players' actions and progress, and to distribute rewards for their achievements. For example, players who successfully complete a quest could earn in-game tokens that they can use to purchase new equipment or unlock new abilities.

3. Community features: The MVP would include basic community-building and collaboration features, such as the ability for players to form teams and work together to complete quests and challenges. The game could also include a simple messaging system to enable players to communicate with each other and coordinate their efforts.

4. Basic game world: The MVP would include a basic game world for players to explore, with a small number of quests and challenges for them to complete. The game world could be expanded and added to over time as the game grows and develops.

Overall, the MVP of a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network with a focus on community-building and collaboration would provide a foundation for the game, with the potential to add more features and content as the game progresses.

### Name all the smart contracts that we will need for the MVP:

The MVP of a blockchain-based ARG on the Arbitrum network with a focus on community-building and collaboration would require the following smart contracts:

- A character creation contract, which would allow players to create and customize their adventurer characters.
- A rewards contract, which would track players' actions and progress, and distribute in-game tokens as rewards for their achievements.
- A team formation contract, which would enable players to form teams and work together to complete quests and challenges.
- A quest and challenge contract, which would track the status of quests and challenges, and allow players to complete them and earn rewards.
- A messaging contract, which would enable players to communicate with each other and coordinate their efforts.

Note: The specific smart contracts required for the MVP may vary depending on the specific features and mechanics of the game. These are just some examples of the types of smart contracts that could be used in a blockchain-based ARG.

### The MVP should also use an existing NFT (named ADV) in the player registration contract, and use that ADV NFT's attributes metadata (strength, agility, wisdom) to generate the stats of the newly registered player.

### Please write the smart contract for the character creation contract. Solidity v0.8.0:

This contract allows players to create and customize their adventurer characters by calling the createCharacter function. The function takes the character's name, level, health, strength, and intelligence as arguments, and stores the character's information in a struct. The contract also tracks the number of characters that each player has created, and limits the maximum number of characters that a player can create.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Character creation contract

// This contract allows players to create and customize their adventurer characters.

contract CharacterCreation {

  // The maximum number of characters that a player can create.
  uint256 public maxCharactersPerPlayer;

  // A mapping of player addresses to the number of characters they have created.
  mapping(address => uint256) public playerCharacters;

  // A struct for storing character information.
  struct Character {
    string name;
    uint256 level;
    uint256 health;
    uint256 strength;
    uint256 intelligence;
  }

  // An array of all characters that have been created.
  Character[] public characters;

  // The constructor sets the maximum number of characters that a player can create.
  constructor(uint256 _maxCharactersPerPlayer) public {
    maxCharactersPerPlayer = _maxCharactersPerPlayer;
  }

  // This function allows a player to create a new character.
  function createCharacter(string memory _name, uint256 _level, uint256 _health, uint256 _strength, uint256 _intelligence) public {
    // Check if the player has reached the maximum number of characters they can create.
    require(playerCharacters[msg.sender] < maxCharactersPerPlayer, "You have reached the maximum number of characters you can create.");

    // Increment the player's character count.
    playerCharacters[msg.sender]++;

    // Create the new character and store it in the characters array.
    characters.push(Character(_name, _level, _health, _strength, _intelligence));
  }
}

```

### Please write the smart contract for the rewards contract. Solidity v0.8.0:

This contract tracks players' information (e.g., level, score) and allows them to earn rewards by calling the earnReward function. The function takes the player's address and the amount of tokens to be awarded as arguments, and calls the token contract to transfer the tokens to the player.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Rewards contract

// This contract tracks players' actions and progress, and distributes in-game tokens as rewards for their achievements.

contract Rewards {

  // The address of the contract that manages the in-game tokens.
  address public tokenContract;

  // A struct for storing player information.
  struct Player {
    uint256 level;
    uint256 score;
  }

  // A mapping of player addresses to their information.
  mapping(address => Player) public players;

  // The constructor sets the address of the token contract.
  constructor(address _tokenContract) public {
    tokenContract = _tokenContract;
  }

  // This function allows a player to earn a reward.
  function earnReward(address _player, uint256 _amount) public {
    // Check if the player exists in the players mapping.
    require(players[_player].level > 0, "Player does not exist.");

    // Call the token contract to transfer the specified amount of tokens to the player.
    Token(_tokenContract).transfer(_player, _amount);
  }
}

```


### Please write the smart contract for the quest and challenge contract. Solidity v0.8.0:

This contract tracks the status of quests and challenges, and allows players to attempt and complete them by calling the attemptQuestOrChallenge function. The function takes the player's address and the index of the quest or challenge as arguments, and checks if the player has the required level and has not already completed the quest or challenge. If the player is eligible to attempt the quest or challenge, the function sets it as completed for the player and calls the rewards contract to award the player a reward based on the quest or challenge's difficulty.


```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Quest and challenge contract

// This contract tracks the status of quests and challenges, and allows players to complete them and earn rewards.

contract QuestAndChallenge {

  // The address of the rewards contract.
  address public rewardsContract;

  // A struct for storing quest and challenge information.
  struct QuestAndChallenge {
    string name;
    uint256 difficulty;
    bool completed;
  }

  // An array of all quests and challenges.
  QuestAndChallenge[] public questsAndChallenges;

  // A mapping of player addresses to the quests and challenges they have completed.
  mapping(address => bool[]) public playerQuestsAndChallenges;

  // The constructor sets the address of the rewards contract.
  constructor(address _rewardsContract) public {
    rewardsContract = _rewardsContract;
  }

  // This function allows a player to attempt a quest or challenge.
  function attemptQuestOrChallenge(address _player, uint256 _index) public {
    // Check if the specified quest or challenge exists.
    require(_index < questsAndChallenges.length, "Quest or challenge does not exist.");

    // Check if the player has already completed the quest or challenge.
    require(!playerQuestsAndChallenges[_player][_index], "Quest or challenge has already been completed.");

    // Check if the player has the required level to attempt the quest or challenge.
    require(players[_player].level >= questsAndChallenges[_index].difficulty, "Player does not have the required level to attempt this quest or challenge.");

    // Set the quest or challenge as completed for the player.
    playerQuestsAndChallenges[_player][_index] = true;

    // Call the rewards contract to award the player a reward.
    Rewards(_rewardsContract).earnReward(_player, questsAndChallenges[_index].difficulty * 10);
  }
}


```

### Please write the smart contract for the messaging contract. Solidity v0.8.0:

This contract allows players to send and receive messages by calling the sendMessage and getMessages functions, respectively. The sendMessage function takes the message as an argument and stores it in the messages array. The getMessages function returns an array of the player's messages.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Messaging contract

// This contract enables players to communicate with each other and coordinate their efforts.

contract Messaging {

  // A struct for storing message information.
  struct Message {
    address sender;
    string message;
  }

  // An array of all messages.
  Message[] public messages;

  // This function allows a player to send a message.
  function sendMessage(string memory _message) public {
    // Store the message in the messages array.
    messages.push(Message(msg.sender, _message));
  }

  // This function allows a player to retrieve their messages.
  function getMessages() public view returns (Message[] memory) {
    // Create an array to store the player's messages.
    Message[] memory playerMessages;

    // Loop through all messages and add the player's messages to the array.
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
      if (messages[i].sender == msg.sender) {
        playerMessages.push(messages[i]);
      }
    }

    // Return the array of player messages.
    return playerMessages;
  }
}

```


### How do all 4 of these contracts interact with each other for players to play the game?

All four of these contracts would interact with each other to enable players to play the game. For example, when a player completes a quest or challenge, the QuestAndChallenge contract would call the Rewards contract to award the player a reward. Then, the player could use the in-game tokens that they earned to purchase new equipment or abilities using the Token contract. The player could also use the Messaging contract to communicate with other players and coordinate their efforts in completing quests and challenges.

Overall, the four contracts would work together to enable the core gameplay mechanics of the game and enable players to progress and earn rewards. The specific interactions between the contracts may vary depending on the specific features and mechanics of the game.
